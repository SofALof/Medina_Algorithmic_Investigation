[ Algorithmic Investigation Summer 2021: an in-depth dive into a variety of CS and Mathematical Algorithms ] 


This repository serves as a home base for a passion project (as well as a summer mentorship project) of mine. I am conducting a thourough 
Investigation of various CS algorithms that I find particularly fascinating. My aim is to have a well documented file (for each algorithm)
that includes history of algorithm, discussions on its uses and different optimizations, but most importantly a step-by-step explanation 
of the given algorithm organized in a way that allows a (dedicated) reader to have a fairly good understanding without having to struggle 
with overly technical language or purely mathematical formulas.


The repository is organized in the following manner:

Each Algorithm has:
- A folder full of python files of the various "steps" of each algorithm, each file (for the most part) is fairly well-organized and comprehensive
- A Jupyter Notebook file; of the entire algorithm, complete with explanation, discussions, and images/graphics
